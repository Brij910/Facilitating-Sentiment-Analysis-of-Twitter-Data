## Overview

The increasing use of social media sites, the large
amount of data has been generated from these sites. A huge
number of users share lots of tweets and information related
to current topics and opinions every day. Sentiment analysis of
twitter can be used as a quick and easy tool to track public
perceptions about an organization’s brand, business and other
topics. Twitter has a short message system which leads to use
of informal words to express the feeling or emotions for specific
topics. Because of this, improvement on the process of analyzing
twitter data must be done. In this study, I have decided
to implement a supervised machine learning approach with
the consideration of semantic features of tweets. This feature
connects an entity with its semantic concept. Additionally, this
study also reveals the accuracy difference for two conditions:
considering stop-words and emoticons, removing the stop-words
and emoticons.
