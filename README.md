## Overview

With the increasing use of social media sites, a large amount of data has been generated from these sites. A huge number of users share lots of tweets and information related to current topics and opinions every day. Sentiment analysis of Twitter can be used as a quick and easy tool to track public perceptions about an organization’s brand, business and other topics. Twitter has a short message system that leads to the use of informal words to express the feeling or emotions for specific topics. Because of this, an improvement in the process of analyzing Twitter data must be done. In this study, I have decided to implement a supervised machine learning approach with the consideration of semantic features of tweets. This feature connects an entity with its semantic concept. Additionally, this study also reveals the accuracy difference for two conditions: considering stop-words and emoticons, removing the stop-words and emoticons.

## Motivation

Considering the increasing demand of social media giants, the importance of the information shared on that platforms is getting increasing day by day. Twitter has a large number of reputed accounts which share informative tweets and users are giving their sentiment by replying to tweets. Due to a large amount of data, manual inspection of each tweet is getting harder. So the proposed approach can eliminate the manual analysis of sentiment of Twitter data.
